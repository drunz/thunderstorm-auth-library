# Thunderstorm Auth Library

**Note: This is a public repo**

Thunderstorm auth library is a package mainly for integrating authentication
provided by the 
[Thunderstorm User service](https://github.com/artsalliancemedia/thunderstorm-user-service).
It also provides access to other common tools such as logging until we find a
better place for them.

## Installation

Install this library from a tarball on Github.
Optionally add the web framework of choice as an extra to install extra
components for those frameworks.

e.g. for Flask:
```shell
> pip install https://github.com/artsalliancemedia/thunderstorm-auth-library/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/thunderstorm-auth-lib-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
> pip install thunderstorm-auth-lib[flask]
```

## Authentication

Authentication is provided by the [user service](https://github.com/artsalliancemedia/thunderstorm-user-service)
with [JWTs](https://jwt.io/).

You will need to include the `TS_AUTH_JWKS` config variable in your Flask
config. The JWKs stored in this variable will be used for decoding JWTs.
See [Thunderstorm User Service](https://github.com/artsalliancemedia/thunderstorm-user-service#using-your-jwt).

### Basic usage

#### Flask

The following decorator will make your views require the JWT issued by the `thunderstorm-user-service`.

```python
from thunderstorm_auth.flask import ts_auth_required

@route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
@ts_auth_required
def hello():
    return jsonify({'message': 'hello world'})
```

When making a request to this endpoint, you must supply your JWT in a HTTP header called
`X-Thunderstorm-Key`.

For example:

```shell
> http localhost:8888/hello X-Thunderstorm-Key:eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1hZnJvMiIsInBlcm1pc3Npb25zIjoiKiIsImV4cCI6MTUwMTg0NTk0OH0.uhRFnfqIaZ91A5xgbqKqQPjdBuOYsuMzIEHA7-j0mzM
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Length: 31
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 04 Aug 2017 09:55:19 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/0.12.2 Python/3.5.3

{
    "message": "hello world"
}
```

When authentication fails:

```shell
> http localhost:8888/hello X-Thunderstorm-Key:egg
HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
Content-Length: 48
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:37:40 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/0.12.2 Python/3.5.3

{
    "message": "Token authentication failed."
}
```

If this header is missing, the request will receive a 401:

```shell
> http localhost:8888/hello
HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 04 Aug 2017 09:55:24 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/0.12.2 Python/3.5.3

{
    "message": "Missing X-Thunderstorm-Key header"
}
```

### Permissions

Each service owns it's permissions so the first thing that must be done to
start integrating permissions is to add a `Permission` model to their database.
At the moment we only support SQLAlchemy models.

#### Flask
```python
from thunderstorm_auth.permissions import create_permission_model

Permission = create_permission_model(Base)
```

Once you have a permission model you can integrate it with your flask app
to give you access to the permission management CLI commands.

```python
from thunderstorm_auth.flask import init_auth

from .database import db
from .models import Permission


def init_app(app):
    """Flask app initialisation and bootstrap"""
    init_auth(app, db.session, Permission)
```

Now that this is integrated you will be able to manage your permissions from
the flask CLI (we haven't created any permissions yet so there won't be any).

```shell
> docker-compose exec myapp flask permissions --help
```

Finally we need to integrate the sync task with our celery app so that our
permissions can be synced up to the user service.

```python
from thunderstorm_auth.setup import init_permissions

from .database import db
from .models import Permission

def init_celery(celery_app):
    """Celery app initialisation"""
    init_permissions(celery_app, db.session, Permission)
```

#### Defining permissions

Now that we have the permissions model, CLI and syncing fully integrated we
can start using permissions.

To require a specific permission for a flask route add the `with_permission`
keyword argument to the `ts_auth_required` route decorator.

```python
from thunderstorm_auth.flask import ts_auth_required


@myapp.route('/foo/bar', methods=['GET'])
@ts_auth_required(with_permission='special')
def get_foo_bar():
    ...
```

Now a request to the `/foo/bar` route will only be allowed if it has a valid
authentication token and that token contains the `special` permission for your
service. In order for that to be possible the user service needs to be made
aware of this new permission.

If you're using flask you can use the flask CLI to manage your service's
permissions. First let's see our permissions.

```shell
> docker-compose exec myapp flask permissions list
Permissions in use
------------------
special

Permissions in DB
-----------------
uuid                                   permission      sent   deleted

AN UPDATE IS NEEDED RUN:
flask permissions update
```

This is telling us that we have one permission in use (`special`) but no
permissions in our database. We need to create a migration to ensure the
appropriate permission record is created in the database. If we're using
alembic we can generate a migration with the CLI

```shell
> docker-compose exec myapp flask permissions update
Generating /var/app/migrations/versions/cab5c9a70124_updating_auth_permissions.py ... done
```

If we run `alembic upgrade` and then `permissions list` again we can see our
permission has been created but not yet sent to the user service. Next time
we start our celery app it will automatically run a task that will send
any unsent permissions up to the user service.

```shell
> docker-compose exec myapp flask permissions upgrade
Permissions in use
------------------
special

Permissions in DB
-----------------
uuid                                   permission      sent   deleted
5c0b17c4-1595-11e8-8c3f-4a0004692f50   special              0      0
```

##### Deployment

When restricting access to a resource we usually want to add the permission to
the users that need access to the resource before adding the restriction so as
to avoid any downtime where authorised users cannot access the resource. In
order to achieve this we must ensure that the migration is deployed to an
environment before the decorator change.

##Â Exceptions

The exception `AuthJwksNotSet` will be raised when `TS_AUTH_JWKS` is missing
from the Flask config.

Both Flask and Falcon raise the following exceptions:
`ExpiredTokenError` - If the token supplied for decoding has expired.
`BrokenTokenError` - If the token supplied was malformed or the token does not match the JWK indicated in its 'Headers' section.

## Development

First you will need to pick a service to develop against.

If, for example, you are working on the `complex-service`, first clone this
repo as a subdirectory of that project.

Next, modify the installation of the auth library. The [complex-service](https://github.com/artsalliancemedia/complex-service/blob/master/env_conf/Dockerfile#L27)
has a line in its `Dockerfile` installing this library from a tarball. Change
this line to the following two lines:

```dockerfile
COPY thunderstorm-auth-library /var/app/thunderstorm-auth-library
RUN pip install -e file:/var/app/thunderstorm-auth-library
```

### Avoiding Exchange Not Found errors in tests

By default an Exchange Not Found error is raised by `init_group_sync_tasks` if
the exchange does not exist. This is useful in deployed environments where
we want to avoid an app silently not binding to the correct exchange. However,
this causes tests to fail because there is no exchange there. To avoid this
set `ensure_exchange_exists` to `False`.

## Testing

Testing accross mutiple Python versions is managed by [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Run them with docker-compose.

```bash
> docker-compose run --rm tox
```

## Releasing

New releases can be easily created using [github-release](https://github.com/aktau/github-release).
Increment the version number in [`thunderstorm_auth/__init__.py`](./thunderstorm_auth/__init__.py),
ensure you have a valid github token and run the following command (replacing
your github token with `{github token}`).

```shell
> GITHUB_TOKEN={github token} release
```
